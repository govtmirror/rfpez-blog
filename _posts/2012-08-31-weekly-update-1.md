Hey folks,

As our fellowship starts rolling along, we're eager to keep you updated about the progress we've been making. Our idea is to split RFP-EZ into several different components, so that we can launch them incrementally and start to get some base hits, instead of waiting to hit the home-run that is RFP-EZ.

As you might have already seen, last week we open-sourced our first project, [SOW Composer](http://www.github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/sowcomposer), which templatizes the process of writing statements of work for government contracts.

Today we're launching another piece of the puzzle, which we're calling [RFPEZ-APIs](http://www.github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/rfpez-apis). Because many of the government datasets that we need to interface with don't have public-facing APIs, we've decided to start making them available for ourselves, and as a bonus, to you, too. RFPEZ-APIs grabs the .csv and tab-delimited data dumps from the [DSBS](http://dsbs.sba.gov) and [EPLS](http://www.epls.gov/), and exposes them to the web in a simple RESTful API format. The best part about this project, however, is that it's built in a modular manner, and that adding a new collection from a .csv file is extremely simple. So mark us down for two projects and two datasets released, here in our second week of the fellowship.(Be on the lookout for our 3rd dataset, coming soon...)

Looking forward, our next step is to start building a database of innovative web development firms who are interested in contracting with the federal government, yet have been dissuaded from it in the past because the barrier to entry was too high. If you're one of these firms, keep an eye out in the next couple weeks for a quick signup form from us. We want to get as many of you as possible into our system, so that we can go to government and say, "all of these companies do amazing work, and they do it at a fraction of the price you've paid in the past." We'll also be showcasing RFP-EZ at various events, starting with the [DC Tech Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Tech-Meetup/events/39214262/) on September 10th, so if you're in town, come find us there!

Until next week,<br />
Adam, Jed, Clay and the rest of the RFP-EZ team
