Happy Friday! It's been a great week here at RFP-EZ, and despite not having another 3 open-source projects to show for it, I can assure you that we're making steady progress towards our goal of making government contracting a realistic endeavor for any small web business.

The feedback on our first few projects has been overwhelmingly positive, and we're thrilled that you think we're moving in the right direction. Now that we're warmed up, we're focusing on getting the ball rolling with the main component of RFP-EZ: a platform that will connect government with the small businesses who can offer them great, innovative web solutions. We have a first draft of mockups in hand, an aggressive launch target for our pilot (November), and a ton of excitement to start telling these small businesses about the new opportunities that we can offer them. While Jed and I (Adam) have been hammering out the more technical details, Clay has been all over town, finding some great contracts that will be ready to bid on once we launch.

We have a lot of work to do by November, but part of what will make RFP-EZ a success is your involvement and feedback. Steve Ressler, of GovLoop fame, wrote a <a href="http://www.govloop.com/profiles/blogs/5-ideas-on-rfp-ez">great blog post</a> about his ideas for RFP-EZ, and we'd encourage anyone to do the same. You can also join the conversation on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ProjectRFPEZ">our Twitter</a>, or if 140 characters isn't your thing, just shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:rfpez@sba.gov">rfpez@sba.gov</a>. We'd love to hear your thoughts or questions about anything we're doing.

Until next week,<br />
Adam, Jed, Clay and the rest of the RFP-EZ team
