Happy Friday everyone!

RFP-EZ has had a busy last couple of weeks as we put the finishing touches on our pilot project. This week and next are all about demonstrations to the acquisitions community inside of government -- essentially the same demonstration that we gave to you [last week](http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.com/rfpez-blog/2012/10/24/Our-Screencast/), but in front of live human beings at places like the Front Line Forum and for the [Rising Acquisition Professionals](http://rapcomm.org/), where we even got to meet Procurement Legend [Ralph Nash](http://www.fedpubseminars.com/Page/?id=21). The feedback that we've gotten has been great.

But talking to people inside the government is only half of the battle; we've also got to get small businesses involved. As such, Jed went and talked to [Ignite Chicago](http://www.ignitechi.org/), we spoke at a [DC Week Panel](http://dcweek2012.sched.org/event/129895315e6c0ce5f6fe453db29b51ee#.UJ1khuOe_D0) and today Adam is speaking at [Reboot America](http://www.rebootamerica.org/).

We're also on the prowl for acquisitions to run through our pilot. So if you're at an agency and have a simple technology project that needs to get done, now's the time!

Look for more news next week -- we should have some announcements on the procurements we'll run, and hopefully be in a place where we can start letting you know how you can register for the RFP-EZ project. So if you're a small business itching to show the world your chops, we're almost there!

Stay Tuned!
