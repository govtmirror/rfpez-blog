It's been another fun-filled week at Project RFP-EZ. On Monday, I presented at the DC Tech Meetup, asking the audience to <a href="http://sba.gov/rfpez" target="_blank">sign up</a> to be part of our pilot program, and I can now say that we've got a ton of talented folks that are waiting for the chance to bid on government contracts. The really exciting part is that many of them are totally new to government contracting, which nicely fits with our goal of making these opportunities inclusive, instead of exclusive, by default.

We haven't been slacking on the code front this week either. Adding to the 2 APIs that we've already published, we're proud to announce that we're pulling in all new contracting opportunities from <a href="http://www.fbo.gov" target="_blank">FedBizOpps</a> and exposing them in a <a href="http://rfpez-apis.presidentialinnovationfellows.org/opportunities">RESTful JSON API</a>.

As far as our progress on RFP-EZ goes, we're currently working through a round of wireframes and getting ready to start coding the backend database structure. This will happen publicly on GitHub, so be sure to <a href="http://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/rfpez" target="_blank">keep an eye out</a>!

Here's where we need your help:

##### Are you a government buyer?

Get in touch! Email us at <a href="mailto:rfpez@sba.gov">rfpez@sba.gov</a> if you're interested in running a procurement through RFP-EZ.We promise it'll be worth your while.

##### Are you a web business?

We're super excited for you to take advantage of the opportunities we have for you. Sign up at <a href="http://sba.gov/rfpez" target="_blank">sba.gov/rfpez</a> and we'll let you know when contracts are ready to be bid on.

Until next week,<br />
Adam, Jed, Clay and the rest of the RFP-EZ team
