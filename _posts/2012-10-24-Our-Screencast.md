# Take a Look at RFP-EZ

We're plugging along building out RFP-EZ, and we're at a point where we'd love to hear your feedback. We haven't quite got the software ready on a public server for you to try out yet, but here's a good screencast of what we're up to. If you've got feedback, please send us an email to rfpez@sba.gov.
