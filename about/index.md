<p><em>Building a platform that makes it easier for small high-growth businesses to navigate the federal government, and enables agencies to quickly source low-cost, high-impact information technology solutions.</em></p>

<h3>What is RFP-EZ?</h3>

<p>RFP-EZ is working to create a streamlined process for the federal government to do business with small high-growth companies. Right now, many of the best tech companies view the process for selling to the government as too long and too complicated. The result is suboptimal for both the government and the companies who potentially miss out on a large market opportunity. The RFP-EZ team is building a prototype process for federal agencies to source low-cost, high-impact solutions from innovative tech companies. The success of this effort will result in 1) better and less expensive products and services for the federal government, saving taxpayer dollars and improving results delivered, and 2) easier access to the government marketplace for high-growth start-ups, helping to fuel job growth throughout the country.</p>
